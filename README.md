## Getting Started

### Backend

Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd GameShop-Backend
```

#### Setting Up the Database Locally

1. Create a new PostgreSQL database named `game_shop`:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE game_shop;
   ```
2. Ensure the following properties are set in `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/game_shop
   spring.datasource.username=postgres
   spring.datasource.password=321Group9
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   ```

#### Building

Build the project using Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

#### Running

Start the Spring Boot application:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

#### Testing

1. Ensure the database is correctly set up and accessible.
2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```

#### Integration Testing

1. Ensure the database is correctly set up and accessible.
2. Run integration tests:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew integrationTest
   ```

### Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd GameShop-Frontend
```

#### Installing Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### Running the Application Locally

```bash
npm run start
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Building the Application

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Testing the Application

```bash
npm run test
```
### Default Manager Credentials

Upon the startup of the backend, a default manager account is automatically created. This account can be used to log in and access the manager-specific features of the Game Shop.

**Manager Credentials:**

- **Email**: `manager@gameshop.com`  
- **Password**: `Manager@123`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: It is strongly recommended to change the default credentials after the first login to ensure security.
